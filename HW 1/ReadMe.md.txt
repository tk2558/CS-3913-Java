Create a window with 8 buttons (this may change, in the future, to 100 buttons 
so make sure to be able to do that easily, hint: use an array) organized in a 
4x2 grid.  Have the background color (see java class Color) of each button start 
at some random value (See java class Random).  When a button is pressed, it 
should cause every OTHER button to change background color.  The button pressed 
should not change background color at all.
